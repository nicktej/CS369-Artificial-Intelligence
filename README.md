# CS369-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains projects and labs I worked on for my AI class at Lewis &amp; Clark College. The projects include a vacuum, tic tac toe, othello, polynomial regression analyisis, k means clustering, eight puzzle game, data visualization, and CIFAR10 analysis. Tools used includes Panda, Sklearn, Numpy, TensorFlow, etc.

### Vacuum
This project was my first introduction into AI. We built 3 vacuums with different levels of intelligence. The idea was to test how having knowledge of the previous environment changes the actor.

### Tic Tac Toe
This project was to create a computer to play Tic Tac Toe with. It was my first dive into having a computer respond with a smart move against me. 

### Othello
This is another project utilizing the computer as an opponent. This is more complex compared to Tic Tac Toe as there are more permutations and positions to consider. 

### Eight Puzzle
A simplex example of how long it takes for a computer to solve the eight puzzle, which is a variant of the 15 puzzle. It calculates the manhattan distance and euclidean distance, which helps optimize its actions.

### Polynomial Regression Analysis
This project uses Sklearn to create various graphs of 5th degree. Then, an AI tries to utilize different degrees to mimic the parth of the graph. The idea is to visualize underfitting and overfitting. 

### K-means Clustering
This project demonstrates the K-means Clustering algorithm. The project shows visually how an AI would find the mean location of each node.

### Data Visualization
This project is a simple data visualization exercise. I imported data and attributes of wine, parsed it and allowed the user to choose what variables they would like to use to visualize the characteristics of the wine.

### Cifar10 Analysis
By far my proudest project in this class. This program utilized my college's cluster to detect images within the CIFAR10 set. We wrote code that allowed us to choose which image to visualize. More importantly, we made a CNN with 5 hidden layers and pooling layers to detect and analyze the layers. There were 50 epochs, and we used a softmax layer too. Ultimately, my program had an accuracy of 65~70%. Improvements could be made by transforming, flipping and coloration of the images.

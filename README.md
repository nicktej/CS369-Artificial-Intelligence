# CS369-Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains projects and labs I worked on for my AI class at Lewis &amp; Clark College.

My proudest project is using Tensor Flow to do image recognition on the CIFAR10 images. It is in the zip file called cifar10.zip. The project uses 5 CNN layers, and has an accuracy between 65-70%.
